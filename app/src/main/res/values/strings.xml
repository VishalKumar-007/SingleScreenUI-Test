            including, without limitation, any transmission, exchange of information or communication associated with the Services.

            any other policies, rules and provisions which are described, linked or otherwise referred to and form a part of this Agreement,
            including, without limitation our Privacy Policy, constitute the entire agreement between you and us, superseding any and all
            prior or inconsistent understandings, representations or agreements regarding the Services. PMI reserves the right to modify the
            terms of this Agreement at any time, and will post a notice of such changes. The changes become effective immediately upon posting
            (the "Effective Date"). If any change to the Agreement is not acceptable to you, you must stop using the Services. Your use of the
            Services after the Effective Date shall constitute your acceptance of such changes. If we make any new products or services
            available, they will be considered a part of the Services and your use of them will be governed by the terms and conditions of
            this Agreement unless we notify you that different terms and conditions apply. You must also comply with any additional terms
            which apply to third-party content, material, information, software or other services.
